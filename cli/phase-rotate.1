\fB\-a\fR, \fB\-\-angle\fR <n>[,<n>]*
specify phase angle to apply
.TP
\fB\-f\fR, \fB\-\-fftlen\fR <num>
process\-block size, freq. resolution
.TP
\fB\-h\fR, \fB\-\-help\fR
display this help and exit
.TP
\fB\-l\fR, \fB\-\-link\-channels\fR
use downmixed mono peak for analysis
.TP
\fB\-s\fR, \fB\-\-stride\fR <num>
analysis step\-size
.TP
\fB\-v\fR, \fB\-\-verbose\fR
show processing information
.TP
\fB\-V\fR, \fB\-\-version\fR
print version information and exit
.PP
This utility analyzes the given audio file to find a phase\-rotation
angle that results in minimal digital\-peak, while retaining overall
sound and loudness.
.PP
If both input and output file are given, the analysis results applied, and
a new file with optimized phase is written. Otherwise the analysis results
are only printed to standard output.
.PP
Analysis is performed in two steps, first a coarse analysis is performed,
calculating peak for angles distanced `stride' degrees apart. Then local
minimums are explored in a second step.
.PP
Verbose analysis allows to plot the digital peak vs phase\-rotation.
The output is in gnuplot(1) data file format.
.PP
If the \fB\-a\fR option is specified, no analysis is performed but the given,
phase\-angle(s) are directly applied. This requires both input and output
files to be given. If a single angle is given it is applied to all channels
of the file. Otherwise one has to specify the same number of phase\-angles as
there are channels in the file.
.SH EXAMPLES
phase\-rotate \-l my\-music.wav out\-file.wav
.PP
phase\-rotate \-vv \-s 3 my\-music.wav
.PP
phase\-rotate \-a 10,20 in.wav out.wav
