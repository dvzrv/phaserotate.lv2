.PP
This utility analyzes the given audio file to find a phase\-rotation
angle that results in minimal digital\-peak, while retaining overall
sound and loudness.
.PP
If both input and output file are given, the analysis results applied and,
a new file with optimized phase is written. Otherwise the analysis results
are only printed to standard output.
.PP
Analysis is performed in two steps, first a coarse analysis is performed,
calculating peak for angles distanced `stride' degrees apart. Then local
minimums are explored in a second step.
.PP
Verbose analysis allows to plot the digital peak vs phase\-rotation.
The output is in gnuplot(1) data file format.
